# Hyperjava

This repository contains some Java exercise projects from the website [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/). These small projects go from the
basics of Java to advanced concepts.

### Structure of this repository:

In order to keep organized and centralized, each project will be made into their own package and have their own Main class (some projects can be made using just a few files).
If a project is too big or requires many folders and files (Spring Boot for example), it will be made in a dedicated repository and the link for it will be provided.

### Tools:

- Java JDK 21
- Apache Maven
- Intellij Idea Community Edition
- Fedora Linux

### Dependecies:

- Junit (for tests)
